This C program prompts the user to enter five integer values, then calculates and displays the minimum and maximum values from the entered numbers.</br> 
It initializes an array to store the values and uses a loop to accept input from the user. </br> 
After the first input, it sets the first value as both the minimum and maximum. </br>
As the user enters additional values, the program compares each one to update the min and max variables accordingly. </br> 
Finally, the program outputs the smallest and largest values from the list. This demonstrates basic array handling, conditional logic, and user input in C.
